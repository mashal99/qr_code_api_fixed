# RestAPI for Creating QR Codes

## Fixes Overview

### 1. **Fixed Typos in Code**
- Corrected several typos in the codebase, including:
  - `qr_code.ruter` -> `qr_code.router`
  - `delete_qr_code` -> Corrected parameter name in the deletion logic.
  - `qr-code` -> `qr_codes` for consistency in directory references.

### 2. **Improved CI/CD Configuration**
- Updated GitHub Actions to match the project requirements:
  - Corrected Docker Hub username (`amashaal99` instead of `professor_username`).
  - Fixed environment variables for seamless integration.
  - Adjusted pipeline steps to ensure proper dependency resolution and compatibility.

### 3. **Dependency Version Fixes**
- Resolved version conflicts by updating `requirements.txt`:
  - Upgraded `fastapi` to `0.115.5` and `starlette` to `0.40.0` to address security vulnerabilities.
  - Updated other dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

### 4. **Docker Compose Fixes**
- Added missing ports for FastAPI:
  - Mapped port `8000` for FastAPI service to ensure proper routing.
- Resolved filename and path issues in the Docker Compose configuration.
- Corrected environment variable settings for Docker.

### 5. **Status Code Fixes**
- Fixed incorrect status codes in the `/qr-codes/` endpoint:
  - Properly returned `204 No Content` for delete operations.
  - Ensured correct response handling for all CRUD operations.

### 6. **Enhanced Local Testing**
- Addressed typos and path errors affecting Pytest:
  - Made sure `qr_codes` directory was correctly referenced.
  - Verified all tests passed successfully before deployment.
